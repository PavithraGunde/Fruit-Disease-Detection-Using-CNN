In the field of agriculture Fruits are affected by different climatic conditions. For the farmers it is very 
difficult to identify the fruits that are having disease or not. This will affect the global economy. By 
manual testing of fruits does not give the accurate output. In this method the fruit image is take to 
analyse the disease.First the fruit image is resized in the required manner and the type of the fruit identified by the system. 
The fruits related to input image in the trained dataset must be analysed. And then features such as 
colour, shape and size are extracted from the image and image cluster is identified using k-means 
clustering algorithm. Next convolutional neural network(CNN) is used to find the fruit is infected or not 
infected.
